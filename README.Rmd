# ContentSecurityPolicy

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `ContentSecurityPolicy` is provide a DSL and helpers functions for defining [Content Security Policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP#) to make your Web-Apps more secure.

> Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement to distribution of malware.

*WORK IN PROGRESS - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION*

Feedback and contributors welcome!
